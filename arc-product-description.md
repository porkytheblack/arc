# Arc

**Your database can answer now.**

Arc is a conversational database interface built on [Glove](https://glove.dterminal.net). Connect any database, ask questions in plain language, and get structured answers — complete with live tables, charts, and actionable results rendered directly in the conversation.

No more context-switching between your app, a SQL client, and a spreadsheet. Arc brings your data into a single, intelligent thread.

## What Arc Does

Arc connects to your database, learns its shape, and lets you interact with your data through conversation. It introspects your schema automatically, understands relationships between tables, and presents results through purpose-built UI components — not raw query output.

You can ask simple questions and get instant answers. You can run complex multi-table analyses and see the results laid out clearly. You can execute mutations, monitor patterns, and build reusable query workflows — all without leaving the conversation.

Arc also works with CSVs. Drop a file in, and Arc creates a queryable table from it on the fly. Temporary data becomes first-class data.

## Who It's For

Arc is for developers, data teams, and operators who spend too much time translating between what they need to know and the tools that hold the answers. If you've ever written a throwaway SQL query, pasted results into a spreadsheet, and then explained the findings in Slack — Arc collapses that entire workflow into a single interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Connect** — Point Arc at any supported database. Credentials stay local.
2. **Introspect** — Arc reads your schema, maps relationships, and indexes your structure. Re-introspection can be triggered manually or scheduled.
3. **Converse** — Ask questions, request views, execute operations. Arc translates intent into queries and renders results through rich, interactive UI.
4. **Build** — Save named queries, link tables, create projects. Arc becomes a living workspace around your data.

## Built on Glove

Arc is powered by the [Glove runtime](https://glove.dterminal.net) — an agentic framework where tools render UI and interact with users directly inside the conversation. Every table view, form, chart, and confirmation dialog in Arc is a Glove display component. The result is a database tool that feels less like software and more like a conversation with someone who understands your data.
